  - working closely with us on machine translation

===================================================
tell you the theory behind machine translation

tell you using open source software we've developed
  - over past 10 years

===================================================
why do you need to understand MT at all?
  - why not just past everything into Google Translate and let it do it for you?

  - one reason is that you get much quality if you control how the system is created
     - we call creating an MT system
      - TRAINING 
during training
  - need 2 main type of data

  - 1st - parallel data in the 2 languages you're translating 2 & from.
            - translation memories you've collected, bitext, dictionaries 
  - 2nd - monolingual data in the target language

   - optionally, also give the training linguistic information such as part-of-speech tags and parse trees.


With the parallel data
  - MT system figure out correspondents between words in the source & target. 
     - you in English <--> vous in French. eg
With the monolingual data
  - figure out what is a fluent, grammatical sentence in the output language
	
We call the things in the yellow box models
  - the thing that know the correspondence between source and target words
          - TRANSLATION MODEL
  - the thing that knows the fluency of the target language
          - LANGUAGE MODEL

When we want to actually translate a sentence
  - load these models
  - push the sentence thru, get
