hieu from edinburgh university
marcin from uni of posnan
  - working closely with us on machine translation

===================================================
tell you the theory behind machine translation

tell you using open source software we've developed
  - over past 10 years

===================================================
why do you need to understand MT at all?
  - why not just past everything into Google Translate and let it do it for you?

  - one reason is that you get much quality if you control how the system is created
     - we call creating an MT system
      - TRAINING 
during training
  - need 2 main type of data

  - 1st - parallel data in the 2 languages you're translating 2 & from.
            - translation memories you've collected, bitext, dictionaries 
  - 2nd - monolingual data in the target language

   - optionally, also give the training linguistic information such as part-of-speech tags and parse trees.


With the parallel data
  - MT system figure out correspondents between words in the source & target. 
     - you in English <--> vous in French. eg
With the monolingual data
  - figure out what is a fluent, grammatical sentence in the output language
	
We call the things in the yellow box models
  - the thing that know the correspondence between source and target words
          - TRANSLATION MODEL
  - the thing that knows the fluency of the target language
          - LANGUAGE MODEL

When we want to actually translate a sentence
  - load these models
  - push the sentence thru the models, get output translation 

===================================================

machine translation
  - 1 of the earliest use of computers
 
however, current best performing types of systems
  - trace their roots back to pioneering work done researchers at IBM
  - took statistical approach being used in speech recognition
  - applied it machine translation
     - our subfield is called STATICAL machine translation
     - differentiate it from RULE-BASED, EXAMPLE-BASED mt

In the beginning
  - progress was slow
  - concentrated on translating word-by-word

Then someone had the bright idea
  - lets trasnlating multiple words at the same time.
     - multiple-worsds --> phrases
  - such a simple, but powerful, idea
     - even today, still producing state of the translations
         - many languages pairs
  - and good enough for many others
  - it's simplicity makes it fast.

  - this is the system you've prob implemented here

however, today, the current research more linguistically motivated systems
  - don't just translate phrases, but translate tree fragments

===================================================
b
The 1st software that implemented phrase-based model
  - called Pharoah
  - implemented by my supervisor
Then i came along
  - rather than use Pharoah, wrote my own

For various reasons, it was adopted by a lot of people
  - part of some major EU projects

4 years later
  - still hadn't finished my phd
  - added tree-based models to moses

past 2.6 years
  - the eu are funding a project that maintain this software
  - i work full time to maintain moses
     - disseminate information about it 
     - by giving talks suc as this

Doesn't fund just me
  - research events, business outreach initiatives, 
  - ad-hoc collatbrations, marcin came to edinburgh for 3 months, paid by the MosesCore project
 
===================================================

We love to people to use Moses
  - try our darndsest to make it easier to use

However, to get the best translation quality
  - it has to be built by academic, for academic

Moses is the reference implemntation that most academic use
  - when they want something to compare against.

It is the goto toolkit
  - if you want new gizmos you've read about

It is the goto toolkit
  - if you HAVE new gizmos and you want to try it out

===================================================

Moses is increaslingly being adopted by organisation that want to use MT
  - has a liberal open source license

Its emphasis on translation quality makes it comparable with closed-source systems
 - given the same trainingdata

HOWEVER,
  - not easy to use
  - we don't do any of the integration into your workflow
     - want a plugin for MS word or Trados
        - do it yourself

===================================================
if u wanna know about orgonations that uses it
  - search online for these organisation
 
find youtube videos & slides of people talkig about trheir experience 
  - implmenenting Moses in their organisations

===================================================

In this tutorial
contrate on phrase0based translation model

where multiple-words, or phrases, are translated to other phrases
  - with some reordering

===================================================
